## Project idea
The goal of this system is to facilitate product search for average consumers. Today, the number of new electronic devices released to the market is growing rapidly, thus finding the most suitable product becomes difficult, especially when the user is not tech-savvy. Our team seeks to solve this issue by developing an intuitive search system that allows consumers to find the product that matches their needs.

## Concept
The search system is based on analyzing answers to questions about the product. System interface contains a list of easily comprehensible questions, which can be in the from of multiple choice answer, range selection and other elements. When enough questions are answered, the system will pick and list product offers. As the number of answers increases, the offers become more accurate. Each offer contains product specifications, current price and price history as well as stores where the product can be purchased.
1. User answers a number of questions
2. System suggests a product
3. User reviews the suggestion
4. User ends the search or continues by answering more questions

## Services
Registered users can receive latest product recommendations based on previously answered questions, clicks and other actions, which are analyzed by the system. Products can be saved to a custom wish list, where users can track product prices and get remainders. One of the essential functionalities of this service is product comparison. Users are able to select multiple different products and view various differences between them in one page, which aids users with their selection process.

## Development
At the early stages of this project, our plan is to focus on mobile devices; however, this system will likely be expanded beyond that in the future.
